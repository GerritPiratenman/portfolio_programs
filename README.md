# portfolio_programs
These are two programs I am proud of.

Aurora Musicalis is a program me and a friend wrote as core of a project,
it has been written in processing an can probably only be run in processing

Anagramminator is a program I wrote in Java after learning how to work with it in a week.

Both programs contain comments about which parts I wrote, anything that refers to a 'me' refer to me, Yorrick.

Have fun with the programs!
