# portfolio_programs
These are two programs I am proud of.

Aurora Musicalis is a program me and a friend wrote as core of a project,
it has been written in processing an can probably only be run in processing.
One of the music files could not be uploaded because it was too big (it was the complete four seasons of Vivaldi)
This could cause the program to crash the moment that specific file is called.

Anagramminator is a program I wrote in Java after learning how to work with it in a week.

Both programs contain comments about which parts I wrote, anything that refers to a 'me' refer to me, Yorrick.

Have fun with the programs!
